# assignment7
using user class to run this code
the more detialed explaination is above the class

Normally, all the test and main work!
But there's sometime has an error about: [Fatal Error] :1:1: Content is not allowed in prolog.
                                          XML parsing errororg.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 1; columnNumber: 1; Content is not allowed in prolog.
                                          
It seems to me that it might be different encoding format(UTF-8 and UTF-16). I had tried lots of method in Stackoverflow, but the code works and sometimes not.
